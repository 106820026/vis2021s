1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:01,80
Hi, what can I get for you today?

2
00:00:02,50 --> 00:00:03,50
Is this true?

3
00:00:04,50 --> 00:00:08,50
(One of the top ten greatest American dining experience) Yeah

4
00:00:11 --> 00:00:13
Right, can I take your orders?

5
00:00:15,05 --> 00:00:15,80
Ah.

6
00:00:16,20 --> 00:00:20
I will have a banana split with extra cherries...

7
00:00:20,50 --> 00:00:23
Some blueberry pancakes...

8
00:00:23,30 --> 00:00:25,10
and a hot chocolate with cream.

9
00:00:25,20 --> 00:00:27
Ha-ha, you're hungry.

10
00:00:27,10 --> 00:00:30
He-he-ha, and a extra fucking spoon.

11
00:00:31,40 --> 00:00:32,30
Excuse me?

12
00:00:32,90 --> 00:00:33,80
For him.

13
00:00:35 --> 00:00:37
Ok, so you can't use language like that.

14
00:00:37 --> 00:00:39,50
otherwise I'm going to have to ask you and your boyfriend to leave.

15
00:00:41,30 --> 00:00:42,30
Ok.

16
00:00:43,60 --> 00:00:44
Ok.

17
00:00:44 --> 00:00:45
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:45,50 --> 00:00:46,50
Sorry.

19
00:00:47 --> 00:00:48,30
(Sigh)

20
00:00:49 --> 00:00:52,50
I will have a great big banana shit...

21
00:00:52,60 --> 00:00:55
with extra fucking cherries on top of it.

22
00:00:55 --> 00:00:56,50
Ok, sorry that's it. Right.

23
00:00:56,55 --> 00:00:57
Marvin!

24
00:00:57 --> 00:00:59
Oh, yeah, go get Marvin.

25
00:00:59 --> 00:01:01,80
See if Marvin can make a banana split for me

26
00:01:01,90 --> 00:01:03,10
You fucking cunt.

27
00:01:06,80 --> 00:01:08,50
Bye, Marvin!
