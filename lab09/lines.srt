Hi what can I get for you today?

Is this true?

(One of the top ten greatest American dining experience) Yeah

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Right can I take your orders?

For him.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,500
Ok so you can't use language like that.

13
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,500
otherwise I'm going to have to ask you and your boyfriend to leave.

14
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,300
Ok.

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,000

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,500
Ok sorry that's it. Right.

22
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:57,000

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Oh yeah go get Marvin.

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,800
